# rustyknife

This is a fork of the existing [`rustyknife`](https://github.com/jothan/rustyknife) library.
I’m not going to bother to contribute back, since I’ve formatted the entire codebase.

various TODOs:
- Comb through the code and remove unnecessary allocations (seems there might be lost of them)
- Actually write docs
- update `nom` from v6 to v8
